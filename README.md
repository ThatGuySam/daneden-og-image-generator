# daneden.me OpenGraph Image Generator

This repo provides a serverless function, deployed on Zeit Now, which generates a 1200x1200px image for OpenGraph cards with a provided title.

It's used on my website, [daneden.me](https://daneden.me), to automatically generate images to be attached to social media shares of my blog posts.
